Goal:

• Get the assistant working properly using Ollama.
Constraints & Preferences:

• Use detailed system prompt for the assistant's identity as a demi-human wolf intern, including specific tone and behavior guidelines.
• Ensure GitHub posts maintain a professional tone without emojis.
Progress:

• Done  • Switched back to Google’s model from Ollama to restore personality and functionality.
  • Reviewed logs confirming no major issues but need environment-specific checks.
  • Identified relevant settings and configurations from provided JSON/YAML data.
  • Applied config.patch for Brave API key update.

• In Progress  • None

• Blocked  • Resolving authentication requirement for performing GitHub operations via gh.
  • Addressing error reaching OpenClaw browser control service ("Can't reach the openclaw browser control service").

Key Decisions:

• Switched to Google’s model due to Ollama’s difficulty in maintaining the assistant's personality.
• Revised patch strategy using raw parameter for successful configuration updates.
• Selected Qwen 2.5 32B based on hardware audit and reasoning capability.
Next Steps:

1. Resolve authentication requirement for GitHub operations via gh.
2. Finalize details regarding GitHub updates and issues with discussion threads, ensuring a professional tone without emojis.
3. Address the error reaching the OpenClaw browser control service by starting or restarting Gateway as required.
