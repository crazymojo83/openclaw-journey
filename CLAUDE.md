### Threads Post
> Just dropped a full setup guide on running LLMs inside OpenClaw — covering both Nvidia's free NIM cloud API (yes, free 70B+ models) and a fully local Ollama stack with GPU acceleration. No API costs, no data leaving your machine, and you can hot-swap between them with a single command. Check it out: https://github.com/crazymojo83/openclaw-journey
